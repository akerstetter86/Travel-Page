                Barbados is a coral island, pushed out of sea by volcanic activity in a far away time. On the West Coast, beaches of fine white sand stretch along a blue-green sea. Coral reefs fringe coast providing excellent snorkeling and Scuba Diving. Along the East Coast a lively surf is blown briskly by the strong and constant trade winds and the waves pound against a rocky shore. The constant breeze of the trade winds gives the island a mild and pleasant tropical climate.

                When you visit, you will see it is mostly a flat coral island with excellent beaches, but there are also rolling hills and many deep ridges and gullies, with an interesting distribution of flora and fauna. Within the coral core there is a vast array of caves and underground lakes which provide an excellent supply of drinking water that is amongst the purest in the world. Geologically Barbados is unique, being actually two land masses that merged together over the years. This and other anomalies make this Caribbean island quite phenomenal, and there are geological structures that you will find only here.

            <h3>Harrison's Cave Tour</h3>

            <p>
                Harrison’s Cave is a massive stream cave system that is at least 2.3 kilometres long. Interior temperature is an average 27 degrees Celsius and its largest cavern, the Great Hall measures 15 metres high. Harrison’s Cave is considered an active cave as it carries water, and it is very much alive as its stalagmites are still growing

            <h3>George Washington House</h3>

                George Washington, later to become the 1st President of the United States of America, visited Barbados in 1751 and spent about two months. Barbados was the only country he ever visited outside colonial America. This fact alone should make a tour of George Washington House, the place where he stayed while in Barbados, a must-do activity for all visitors from the USA. The House, now appropriately under the control of the Barbados National Trust, is also of interest to other visitors, including Barbadians, as it gives useful insights into life as it was in the Barbados of 250 years ago.

            <h3>Smitons Bay</h3>

                On the north-west coast of Barbados is the lovely Smitons Bay, a quiet shaded beach that beckons you to stop and stay a while.  The beach is generally very quiet and uncrowded with just the occasional catamaran and fishing boat sailing languidly by. Relax under the shade of the trees and feel your cares fading away. You can also grab a mask and snorkel to explore the inshore reefs surrounding the bay. The reefs create a shallow shoreline, making this bay the perfect spot for children to sea-bathe.
